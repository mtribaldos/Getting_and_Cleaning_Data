# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in Coursera.

## Files

- `README.md`: this file
- `Codebook.md`: describes the how to use all this, variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data
- `run_analysis.R`: R file contaning the code to perform the analysis required on the project. It generated the file "tidy_dataset.txt"  

## Install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mtribaldos/Getting_and_Cleaning_Data.git
```

## Usage

Enter the R command line interpreter and type:

```
> source("run_analysis.R")
> run_analysis()
```

After that, the file "tidy_dataset.txt" is created. This course project's form gets fed with the contents from this file.
